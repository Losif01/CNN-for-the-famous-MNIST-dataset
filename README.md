# CNN for the Famous MNIST Dataset

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Project Structure
- **`MNIST`**: the notebook, with code
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/Losif01/CNN-for-the-famous-MNIST-dataset.git
    cd CNN-for-the-famous-MNIST-dataset`

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   `python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate`
   
3. Install the required packages:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`



This script will load the saved model and calculate the accuracy on the test set.

#### Visualizing Results

For visualizing the results and understanding the model's predictions, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Results

The CNN model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test set. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations can be found in the notebooks.
